# Color & images

* The img element is used to add images to a         web page.

* You must always specify a Xsrc attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

* ou should save images at the size you will be using Xthem on the web page and in the appropriate format.

* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or Xlogos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps Xconvey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:            XRGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast Xbetween any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to Xindicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, Xwith an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# Text

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, Xweight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume Xmost people will have installed.

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are Xseveral options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

* You can control the space between lines of text, Xindividual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an Xelement when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
