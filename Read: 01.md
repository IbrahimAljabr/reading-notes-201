# Introduction JS

* A  script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in  order to achieve a goal. 

* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 

* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 

* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

* A  script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
