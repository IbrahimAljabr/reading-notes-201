# Text and Basic JavaScript

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
X
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
X
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

* A  script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in  the script.

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

* Expressions evaluate into a single value.

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
