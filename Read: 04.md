## Lab 4

# Links:

* Links are created using the <a> element.

* The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

* You can create links to open email programs with an 
X
email address in the "to" field.

* You can use the 
X
id
 attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to.


# Functions, Methods, and Objects:

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
